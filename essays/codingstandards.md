When it comes to coding standards, I generally find them to be very helpful. Following them at times is challenging, but overall they tend to lead to code that is neat, consistent, and readable. The problem arises when in every coding class we are using a different language or program that in turn, has different coding standards. For the most part, this isn’t an issue because usually the coding standards are on a website page that we can reference back to after coding, but for the past week, in my 314 class, we have been required to use ESLint with VSCode.

Now I used VSCode in my 111 class but haven’t used it since then as my other instructors required us to use older programs like Eclipse and Unix. Personally I enjoy the convenience of newer programs, like I don’t enjoy having to compile my code after using Unix to get 20 errors when VSCode just gives me the error message right away in a more clear way. My instructor for 314 brought it back for this year but instead of using it for Java we’re using it for Javascript and have been using ESLint for coding style and I feel like it’s so weird for no reason. The rules feel a lot stricter when compared to other coding styles and it feels like it’s not helping to make the code more readable. In some instances like spacing, it’s exactly like how I like it, but then when I do arrow functions it makes me put it all into one row instead of spacing it out. It makes for these awkward long lines of code that you have to use the horizontal scroll wheel to see. Maybe there is a way to do it without that, but as of this one week I just find it irritating. 

If we’re talking about the title for this essay, the thing that bothers me the most about ESLint is that I keep getting error messages that throw me off. At first I thought it was coding errors BUT SERIOUSLY IT'S JUST A FORMAT ERROR. The main problem I experience is when I press tab but you aren’t supposed to indent like that and it leads to error messages. Like tab is so convenient and I just can’t use it. There are a few other things that I still don’t understand like how I get an error at the end of my code and by adding another empty line at the end it goes away, but these error lines make me so confused at times.

Overall I think Coding Standards are important to have so that code is understandable to anyone reading it, but as of right now ESLint is the bane of my existence and I want to go back to Java.
