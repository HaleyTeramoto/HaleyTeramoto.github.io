Generally in a class, when we are asked by our professor at the end of their lecture whether we have a question, no one raises their hand. Most people will have one concerning a point of discussion or around a confusing sentence on the homework, but those questions will not be asked until it becomes urgent and then are sent in a private email to the instructor. There is a certain stigma, at least in classes, where asking questions makes you seem dumb. By asking the question, you are showcasing your ignorance around the topic. Even if half the class wouldn’t have been able to answer it, you are still the fool who asked and as such are the embarrassment. But asking questions is how one improves themselves. Sure you may have been clueless to the topic when you asked, but now that you’ve asked your gap in knowledge has been filled and as such have a better understanding than those who didn’t. 

Now this isn’t to say that all questions are good questions. Our instructor asked us to read an article by Eric Steven Raymond titled How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, and the article covers exactly that, how to ask a smart question. This was specifically made for StackOverflow so a lot of the parameters the author brings up are things like setting an appropriate and specific title, posting it in the right forum, etc. The main point for a smart question is to not ask questions that waste the answerer’s time. If it’s a question that can be answered with a quick google search, has already been asked and answered in the forum, or is unclear, you are asking a dumb question because it is a question that isn’t asking anything or it’s a question you can answer yourself.

## So what does a smart question look like really?
Now first, what does a bad question look like? For an example of a bad question I looked on StackOverflow for probably less than a minute before I [found one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78937154/how-can-i-use-a-shared-library-in-vlang). The title was How can i use a shared library in vlang and they had put their code along with what it was outputting and were asking what was wrong since nothing was in their sym_map after running. Now this case violates a few of Raymond’s rules. The most obvious is that when I copy and pasted the title into google the first thing to pop up was a previous StackOverflow post that explained how to use a library in vlang. This question has been up for 11 days since my writing of this, viewed 53 times, but no upvotes or comments have been added to it.

Now an example of a good question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78980957/is-it-possible-to-serialise-a-websocket-connection-to-an-external-system-like-re) under the title Is it possible to serialise a websocket connection to an external system like redis cache, and later pick up by an another pod and deserialize connect. Now from the title you can notice a few spelling and grammar errors but it is clear in what they are trying to ask. The question then continues to follow Raymond’s by showing the user did prior research by listing examples of cases related to the question. Again there are a few more grammatical errors throughout, but overall the question is a good question and that is clear in the fact that it was asked today and has already been answered.

## To working smarter, not harder
In class, my instructor will always tell us to look at the assignment first if we have questions. They’ll always say that most questions asked to them can be answered there if you just read carefully. I talked about at the beginning of this article how people are embarrassed to ask questions, but I’ve learned that if it’s a smart question, a question you still have after consulting the resources available to you, you shouldnt be afraid to ask. You’re not wasting other people’s time, you’re not embarrassing yourself, you’re simply educating and improving yourself.
