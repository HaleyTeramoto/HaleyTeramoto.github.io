summary: "How I learned valuable lessons in my time in London"
---
So in my first year of college, I was a history major who hadn’t traveled far from home. I was born and raised on the big island, and I decided to go to college just an island away on Oahu. Now it may have taken me away from living at home but it still felt similar, the culture was similar, and having traveled to Oahu a lot for tennis tournaments, I was used to the scenery as well. It just didn’t feel that different, and so when I got an email saying they were holding an informational session about study abroad I started looking into it and immediately signed up for London. Now, at the time I believed that it would be perfect for a history major like myself, but as I can see now that was a little silly considering I’m now a happy computer science major. But despite that, I still feel as if I learned a lot about being my own person through this experience.

Being in London was the farthest I had ever traveled, and the only time my parents hadn’t been with me out of state. I was honestly terrified because I had never been in a city that large before. Yet that distance and unfamiliarity is what pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me grow. I learned how to make my own meals, how to navigate around the city, and to try new things. At the college I attended, classes were also structured so that attendance wasn’t mandatory, for most I didn’t even have homework, it was just one big final project. Making sure I stayed on top of attending classes, stayed on top of the course work, and started work on the project early into the semester also made me a better worker in general. Overall, studying abroad in London made me a more independent and reliable person.
