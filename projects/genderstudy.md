summary: "A research project I conducted in AP Research about how teens gender identity was portrayed on social media."
---
When I was a Junior in High School I took AP Research, in which the goal of the class was to come up with an original research question and answer it. The question I asked was “How Does GenZ View Gender on TikTok?” This question stemmed from the fact that this was during lockdown, so I spent much of my time on social media since I couldn’t really get out of the house. In particular TikTok became this big thing and in general, there isn’t as much research on social media due to its relative recency.

To research this I just did what you would expect, I watched videos on TikToks related to gender identity, kept track of comments, likes, shares, hashtags, and even the audio used for the video. The main points I took away from the research were the ideas of gender dysphoria, how people viewed gender as fluid and showcased it in presenting as femme and masc, and how both traditional male and female traits were desired by the opposite gender either because they just found it attractive or used it as a way to nonconform. My own research paper goes into more depth of these ideas as well as quoting some of the comments and texts associated with the videos. A good way to understand the reasoning behind these ideas is to read Judith Butler who has published papers talking about the idea of gender being a performative act.
