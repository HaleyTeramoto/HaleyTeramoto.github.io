summary: "A word tracker that implements a binary search tree, used for word frequency analysis on large texts."
---
This was an assignment we were tasked with in 211. We were asked to create an algorithm that implements a binary search tree that would store and process words from a text file. Each word is stored as a key in the tree and tracks how many times it appears. The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with how a binary search tree works.

The intended purpose of this program is to track word frequency on large documents. The binary search tree structure is also good for efficient searching, adding, and removing words based on alphabetical order.
